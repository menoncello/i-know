# Review Story - Workflow Instructions

```xml
<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and language MUST be tailored to {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>
<critical>Only modify the story file in these areas: Tasks/Subtasks checkboxes, Dev Agent Record (Debug Log, Completion Notes), File List, Change Log, and Status</critical>
<critical>Execute ALL steps in exact order; do NOT skip steps</critical>

    <action>Parse the development_status section completely to understand story order</action>

    <action>Find the FIRST story (by reading in order from top to bottom) where:
      - Key matches pattern: number-number-name (e.g., "1-2-user-auth")
      - NOT an epic key (epic-X) or retrospective (epic-X-retrospective)
      - Status value equals "review"

      <output>üìã No stories found in "review" status in sprint-status.yaml
**Options:**
1. Check {output-folder}/sprint-status.yaml to see current story statuses
2. Run dev-story workflow to implement stories and mark them for review

    <action>Store the found story_key (e.g., "1-2-user-authentication") for later status updates</action>
