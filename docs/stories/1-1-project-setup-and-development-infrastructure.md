# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Infrastructure

Status: review

## Story

As a development team,
I want a complete project infrastructure with CI/CD, version control, and development environment,
so that we can build and deploy the application efficiently and reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Repository initialized with proper branching strategy (main, develop, feature branches)
2. CI/CD pipeline configured with automated testing and deployment
3. Development environment setup with local database and API simulation
4. Code quality tools configured (linting, formatting, security scanning)
5. Documentation for development workflow and deployment procedures
6. Environment-specific configuration management (development, staging, production)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Initialize monorepo structure with Turborepo (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create root package.json with workspace configuration
  - [x] Setup workspace configuration for package management
  - [x] Configure turbo.json for build pipeline optimization
  - [x] Initialize Git repository with branching strategy
  - [x] Create main, develop, and feature branch templates

- [x] Setup core applications (web, api, scraper) (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Initialize Astro web application with React and TypeScript
  - [x] Create Elysia backend API with TypeScript
  - [x] Setup Bun scraper service with TypeScript
  - [x] Configure shared packages structure (ui, types, database, utils)
  - [x] Establish inter-app dependencies and imports

- [x] Configure development environment (AC: 3)
  - [x] Connect to existing PostgreSQL Docker instance
  - [x] Create database connection and migration scripts
  - [x] Configure environment-specific .env files for existing database
  - [x] Setup local development scripts and package.json commands
  - [x] Establish database seeding for development data

- [x] Implement code quality and testing infrastructure (AC: 2, 4)
  - [x] Configure ESLint with strict TypeScript rules
  - [x] Setup Prettier for code formatting
  - [x] Implement unit testing framework with Bun test
  - [x] Configure integration and E2E testing structure

  - [x] Create automated testing workflow on pull requests
  - [x] Configure build and deployment pipeline
  - [x] Setup automated code quality checks
  - [x] Implement environment-specific deployment configurations
  - [x] Create security scanning and dependency vulnerability checks

- [x] Create development documentation and deployment guides (AC: 5, 6)
  - [x] Write comprehensive README with setup instructions
  - [x] Document development workflow and contribution guidelines
  - [x] Create deployment procedures for different environments
  - [x] Document API specifications and database schema
  - [x] Create troubleshooting and FAQ documentation

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Requirements

- Turborepo 2.5.9 for monorepo management with intelligent caching
- Bun 1.3.1 runtime for all applications
- PostgreSQL 18.0 for local development database
- TypeScript 5.9.3 with strict mode enabled
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality

### Development Environment Setup

- Connection to existing PostgreSQL Docker instance
- Environment-specific .env files (development, staging, production)
- Package.json scripts for development workflow
- Database migrations and seeding

### CI/CD Requirements

- GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Automated code quality checks (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- Security scanning for dependencies
- Build and deployment pipeline for multiple environments

This is the first story in Epic 1 - no predecessor context available.

### Project Structure Notes

- Follow the monorepo structure defined in architecture.md [Source: docs/architecture.md#Project-Structure]
- Use naming conventions: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
- Implement database-first architecture with PostgreSQL as central communication
- Use UUID v7 for all entity identifiers
