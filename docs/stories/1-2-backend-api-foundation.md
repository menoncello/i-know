- User preferences table with JSONB for flexible settings storage
- Basic content metadata tables for actors and media (foundation for future stories)
- Migration system with versioning and rollback capabilities
- Connection pooling and transaction management

### API Security Requirements

- CORS configuration for mobile app domains
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse (configurable per endpoint)
- Request validation and sanitization
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- API key authentication for internal service communication
- Audit logging for security-relevant events

### Performance Requirements

- Sub-200ms response times for all API endpoints [Source: docs/PRD.md#NFR002]
- Structured logging with performance metrics
- Database query optimization and monitoring
- Health check endpoints for monitoring system status

### Learnings from Previous Story

**From Story 1-1-project-setup-and-development-infrastructure (Status: review)**

- **Project Structure**: Monorepo established with apps/api directory - use existing structure
- **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL Docker instance configured - use existing connection settings
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky configured - maintain standards in API code
- **Testing Framework**: Bun test setup - follow established patterns for API testing
- **Environment Configuration**: .env files established - use existing database credentials
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions configured - API will be included in build pipeline

[Source: stories/1-1-project-setup-and-development-infrastructure.md#Dev-Notes]

### Project Structure Notes

- Place API code in `apps/api/` following monorepo structure [Source: docs/architecture.md#Project-Structure]
- Use kebab-case for file names and PascalCase for class names
- Follow TypeScript strict mode patterns established in project setup
- Implement database-first architecture with PostgreSQL as central communication
- Co-locate API tests with source files in `__tests__` directories
