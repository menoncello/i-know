## Dev Notes

### Architecture Requirements

- **IMDB Data Access**: Revolutionary fast retrieval method providing 100x faster data retrieval than traditional web scraping
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis or in-memory caching for frequently accessed actor and content information
- **Performance Requirements**: Sub-500ms response times for all actor identification queries [Source: docs/PRD.md#NFR002]
- **Data Freshness**: Daily updates with less than 24-hour latency for new content information [Source: docs/PRD.md#NFR004]
- **Technology Stack**: Bun + Elysia + PostgreSQL following established patterns from story 1.1

### Previous Story Learnings

**From Story 1-1 (Status: done):**

- **New Infrastructure Created**: Complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, Turborepo build system, PostgreSQL database integration
- **Technology Stack Established**: Bun 1.3.1 runtime, Elysia backend framework, Astro frontend, TypeScript 5.9.3 strict mode
- **Testing Infrastructure**: 95+ unit tests passing, integration test framework with server management, comprehensive test coverage
- **Code Quality Standards**: ESLint + Prettier enforced via pre-commit hooks, TypeScript strict mode, comprehensive CI/CD quality gates
- **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL 18.0 with migration scripts, seeding procedures, and connection management
- **Project Structure**:
  - Use `apps/scraper/` for IMDB data access implementation
  - Use `apps/api/src/routes/` for API endpoints
  - Use `packages/database/` for database schemas and migrations
  - Use `packages/types/` for TypeScript interfaces
  - Use `packages/utils/` for shared utility functions
- **Development Workflow**: All packages building successfully, proper TypeScript compilation, comprehensive test coverage

### Project Structure Notes

- Follow established monorepo structure from story 1.1 [Source: docs/architecture.md#Project-Structure]
- Use existing PostgreSQL database connection and migration patterns
- Implement IMDB scraper as separate service in `apps/scraper/`
- Create API endpoints in `apps/api/src/routes/imdb/`
- Database schemas should extend existing structure in `packages/database/src/schema/`
- Use co-located test structure: `**/*.test.ts` files alongside implementation
- Follow naming conventions: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components

### Implementation Constraints

- Must use Bun runtime (not Node.js) per project standards [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- Use PostgreSQL database connection established in story 1.1
- Follow TypeScript strict mode patterns from existing codebase
- Implement proper error handling and logging following established patterns
- Ensure all code passes ESLint rules without disabling any rules [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- Test coverage should match story 1.1 standards (95+ tests)
- Performance must meet sub-500ms requirement for all queries
