**Pass Rate:** 10/10 (100%)

✓ **Stack Coherence** - All technologies compatible
  Evidence: PostgreSQL 18.0 with Prisma 5.22.0, Astro builds compatible with nginx, JWT compatible with Elysia
✓ **Integration Compatibility** - All services integrate properly
  Evidence: Database-first communication, PostgreSQL triggers, CDN integration, Bun scheduler

### 7. Document Structure
**Pass Rate:** 6/8 (75%)

✓ **Required Sections Present** - Executive summary, initialization, decision table, structure, patterns
  Evidence: All major sections present with appropriate content
⚠ **Decision table columns** - "Affects Epics" column missing from actual table
  Evidence: Table headers lines 60-61 show "Affects Epics" but table data only shows 4 columns
  Impact: Epic to decision mapping unclear
✗ **Novel patterns section** - No dedicated section for novel patterns
  Evidence: Novel patterns integrated throughout but not centralized
  Impact: Harder to locate custom pattern documentation
✓ **Document Quality** - Professional, focused, well-structured
  Evidence: Clear technical language, appropriate use of tables and code examples

### 8. AI Agent Clarity
**Pass Rate:** 14/14 (100%)

✓ **Clear Guidance for Agents** - All decisions specific and actionable

## Failed Items

### Critical Issue 1: **Version Verification Process Missing**
- Lines: Throughout decision table (60-74)
- Evidence: No documentation of WebSearch usage for version verification
- Impact: May be using outdated versions, especially concerning with Puppeteer 24.27.0

### Critical Issue 2: **Starter Template Integration Incomplete**
- Lines: Project initialization section (7-61)
- Evidence: No explicit marking of Turborepo-provided decisions
- Impact: Unclear which decisions are intentional vs. defaults, potential for duplication

### Critical Issue 3: **Missing Novel Patterns Section**
- Lines: Throughout document
- Evidence: Custom patterns scattered without dedicated section
- Impact: Harder for AI agents to locate and follow custom pattern guidance

## Partial Items

### Item 1: **Breaking Changes Documentation**
- Section: Technology Stack Details
- Missing: Comprehensive breaking changes analysis between versions
- Recommendation: Add breaking changes notes for major version upgrades (React 19, PostgreSQL 18)

### Item 2: **Data Flow Visualization**
- Section: Novel Pattern Design
- Missing: Sequence diagrams for complex service interactions
- Recommendation: Add visual diagrams for database-first communication pattern

### Item 3: **Decision Table Epic Mapping**
- Section: Decision Summary Table
- Missing: "Affects Epics" column data in actual table
- Recommendation: Complete the table with epic mapping information

### Item 4: **Version Verification Dates**
- Section: Version Specificity
- Missing: Dates when versions were verified
- Recommendation: Add verification dates to decision table

## Recommendations

### Must Fix (Critical)
1. **Add Version Verification Documentation** - Document WebSearch usage and verification dates for all technology versions
2. **Complete Starter Template Analysis** - Explicitly mark Turborepo-provided decisions vs. custom choices
3. **Create Novel Patterns Section** - Consolidate custom patterns in dedicated section for easy reference

### Should Improve (Important)
1. **Add Breaking Changes Analysis** - Document potential breaking changes for major version choices
2. **Complete Decision Table** - Add missing "Affects Epics" column data
3. **Add Data Flow Diagrams** - Include sequence diagrams for complex service interactions

### Consider (Minor)
1. **Verify Puppeteer Version** - Confirm 24.27.0 is correct and available
2. **Add Epic to Architecture Cross-References** - Improve traceability between epics and architecture decisions
3. **Add Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** - Expand ADR section with more detailed rationales

## Document Quality Score

- **Architecture Completeness:** Mostly Complete (90%)
- **Version Specificity:** Some Missing (60%)
- **Pattern Clarity:** Crystal Clear (95%)
- **AI Agent Readiness:** Ready (85%)
