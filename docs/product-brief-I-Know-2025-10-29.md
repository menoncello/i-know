## Problem Statement

Entertainment viewers experience significant cognitive friction and time waste when they recognize actors during streaming content but cannot immediately place them across different productions. This "frustração cognitiva" creates a painful interruption to the immersive viewing experience.

**Current State Problems:**
- **Time Waste:** Viewers spend 5-10 minutes per viewing session manually searching IMDB's cluttered interface
- **Experience Interruption:** Users must pause content and switch contexts to satisfy their curiosity
- **Cognitive Load:** "Matutação mental" (involuntary cognitive processing) detracts from entertainment enjoyment
- **Inefficient Solutions:** 86% of viewers use second screens but no integrated solution exists

**Market Failure:**
- **Static Databases:** IMDB and TMDB provide comprehensive data but require manual search effort
- **Celebrity Apps:** Focus on resemblance rather than entertainment context
- **Platform Limitations:** Streaming services offer basic cast info without cross-platform connections
- **No Real-time Integration:** No existing solution provides seamless actor identification during viewing

**Quantifiable Impact:**
- 1.8B global streaming subscribers affected by this problem
- Average 82 minutes daily streaming time = potential 1.4B hours of cognitive friction daily
- Current solutions require context switching, reducing viewing satisfaction by 15-25%

**Why This Must Be Solved Now:**
Growing streaming adoption (44.8% of TV viewership) and second-screen usage (86% of viewers) create perfect timing for a solution that enhances rather than interrupts the entertainment experience.
