## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Eliminate cognitive friction for entertainment viewers by providing instant actor identification in under 3 seconds, compared to 5-10 minutes of manual searching
- Achieve market leadership in the real-time actor identification space by capturing 1.5-8% market share within 3 years, establishing first-mover advantage
- Scale to 1M+ active users with >95% recognition accuracy and sub-500ms response times, creating a defensible technical moat through revolutionary IMDB data access
- Build a sustainable entertainment intelligence business reaching $5M ARR through premium subscription models and strategic B2B partnerships
- Transform from actor identification tool to comprehensive entertainment intelligence platform serving as essential infrastructure for the modern entertainment ecosystem

### Background Context

The entertainment consumption landscape has fundamentally transformed with streaming platforms now representing 44.8% of TV viewership, creating an unprecedented opportunity for companion applications. However, viewers experience significant "frustração cognitiva" - the mental frustration when recognizing actors during content consumption but being unable to place them across different productions. This cognitive friction affects 1.8B global streaming subscribers who currently waste 5-10 minutes per viewing session manually searching through cluttered interfaces like IMDB, interrupting their immersive entertainment experience.

The timing is optimal as 86% of viewers now use second screens during content consumption, yet no integrated solution exists for seamless actor identification. Current solutions like static databases (IMDB, TMDB) require manual effort, celebrity apps focus on resemblance rather than entertainment context, and streaming platforms offer basic cast information without cross-platform connections. The companion app market is projected to reach $7.19B by 2033 (12.6% CAGR), indicating strong market readiness for innovative entertainment enhancement solutions.

I Know addresses this gap through a revolutionary IMDB data access methodology that provides 100x faster data retrieval than traditional web scraping, enabling real-time actor identification without interrupting the viewing experience. This technical innovation, combined with the growing streaming adoption and second-screen usage patterns, creates a perfect market opportunity for a solution that enhances rather than interrupts entertainment consumption.

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Real-time Actor Identification During Streaming

**User:** Sarah, streaming enthusiast watching "Stranger Things" on Netflix

**Flow:**
1. **Content Detection**: Sarah starts streaming → App automatically detects content metadata via Netflix API
2. **Actor Recognition**: Sarah sees unfamiliar actor → Opens I Know app overlay (3-seconds activation)
3. **Instant Identification**: App displays actor profile with character name, other productions, and actor photos
4. **Cross-Reference Discovery**: Sarah explores actor's filmography → Discovers they were in show she missed
5. **Content Tracking**: Sarah marks new show as "Want to Watch" → Adds to personal watchlist

**Decision Points & Alternatives:**
- If automatic detection fails → Manual search option (content title + timestamp)
- If actor not recognized → Confidence score displayed with "Report inaccuracy" option
- If multiple actors in scene → Tap-to-select specific actor for identification
- If internet connection poor → Fallback to cached data with "Limited mode" indicator

### Journey 2: Personalized Content Discovery
